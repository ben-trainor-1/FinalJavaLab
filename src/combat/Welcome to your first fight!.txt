Welcome to your first fight!
Each encounter is structured kind of like rock-paper-scissors.
You and your opponent blindly choose between attacking, defending, and healing.

When you attack, you will deal a random amount of damage based on your character's attack.
Currently, your base attack is *insert attack*. That means you will deal
anywhere between *5 under* and *5 over* damage.
You also have a chance of dealing a critical hit whenever you attack!
Currently, a critical hit would increase the damage dealt by *crit amount*.
If both you and your opponent crit, the enemy will be stunned and open for attack
the next round.

When you defend, you will be protected against all normal attacks.
However, critical hits from your opponent will cut through your defense
and deal the full amount.
If you successfully defend, you will receive a defensive buff in the next round
and receive less damage from any attacks (including critical hits).

When you heal, you will recover a random amount of health based on
your character's heal amount.
Currently, your base heal amount is *insert heal amt*. That means you will heal
anywhere between *5 under* and *5 over* health.
You will be vulnerable to attacks but may mitigate the damage by healing.

Your opponents will use these same tactics against you, so choose wisely!
